## Get started

If you'd like to take a look at what's inside a GDTF file, rename `yourfile.gdtf` to `yourfile.zip`, and unzip it. You can now browse through the containing folders to see what's included. **It is not required for every file to specify all information**. For example, you may find files without any wheels specified. There may be yet another GDTF with no 3D information. So check out a few of them to get a feel for what's included.

### Finding GDTF files

GDTF files can be found on:

* [gdtf-share](https://gdtf-share.com)

### Creating GDTF files

You can use the [fixture builder on gdtf-share](https://fixturebuilder.gdtf-share.com/), or you can create the GDTFs manually by specifying all the files, and zipping them up.

## All available attributes

To describe the fixture types, use attributes. Attributes define the function. (n) and (m) are wildcards for the enumartion of attributes e.g. Gobo(n) - Gobo1 and Gobo2 or VideoEffect(n)Parameter(m) - VideoEffect1Parameter1 and VideoEffect1Parameter2. Attributes without wildcards (n) or (m) are not enumerated. The enumaration starts with 1. The currently defined attributes are specified in the following table:
